Two of my favorite types of design work are invitation suites and event collateral. I using watercolor, and hand lettering to add unique touches to the designs.

I had a lot of fun designing the invitation suite for this wedding, as well as printing and hand trimming the invites and info cards.

I also created the place cards and many of the signs that were featured at my own wedding by hand.
