In late 2018, I had the pleasure of working with the Hershey Handbell Ensemble on a freelance project to design a new logo for the PA-based organization. I created a variety of options that incorporated both a modern and a vintage feel. In the end, the client preferred the more modern, circular design. I also created a few abbreviated logo options to be used for embroidery and other smaller, less detailed items.
