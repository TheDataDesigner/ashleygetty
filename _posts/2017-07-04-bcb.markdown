This logo was designed for a coffee shop in New Cumberland, PA. Brew Crumberland's Best (BCB) came to Stoner Graphix seeking a logo that reflected their eclectic and laid back style. In addition to designing the logo, I also designed the two outdoor signs.

I began with some rough sketches to help the client figure out a more specific design direction.

I then took the designs into digital format. The client favored the top left sketch, so I used that as my guide for most of the designs. They also wanted to include the initials "BCB" to represent Brew Crumberland's Best.

The client favored a rough organic style, so I sketched a coffee mug (and the coffee stain for some of the options) and used it in the next round of revisions. BCB also wanted to explore a few other ideas in this round of revisions, including a chalkboard style and the use of an actual photo of a coffee stain.

The client ultimately chose the coffee stain photo and cup sketch. After a few tweaks to an existing option from the last round of revisions, the client chose this as the final design.

Once the final logo was selected, I used the same style to design two signs for the cafe.

The client has used the logo for business cards, murals, coffee mugs, coffee sleeves, business cards, and more.
