St Paul Collection, a luxury apartment community located in Denver's Cherry Creek neighborhood, came to Worboys Design with the unique idea of using branded bicycles as advertising pieces that could be placed around Cherry Creek. Worboys Design had never worked on a project quite like this before, and I had the opportunity to be the sole designer on the project. I began by finding a bike frame that could effectively emulate a luxurious, upscale look & feel. I then used Photoshop to mock up a design that represented the St Paul brand. I found & sourced a local bike vendor to do all the production work for the project - from the paint job & leather details the custom chain guard, signage panel, & crate. The finished product turned out better than my team & I could have imagined, and we are excited to see these bikes pop up in the Cherry Creek neighborhood. Many thanks to Ian at <a href="http://whiterhinocustoms.com/" target="_blank">White Rhino Customs</a> for his creativity and hard work to help bring this project to completion!
