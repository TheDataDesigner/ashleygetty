Below are some of my favorite logo concepts, showcasing a range of different styles. I am able to adapt my style to accommodate each individual client's needsâ€”whether it's iconic, illustrative, or corporate. I find it enjoyable to dabble in new techniques and expand my stylistic repertoire. All concepts were created for clients of Worboys Design.
