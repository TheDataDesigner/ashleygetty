My coworker and I designed these beer labels as a Christmas present to one of our clients at Stoner Graphix - Freddy Harteis. Freddy has a television show called the Hollywood Hunter, which is what inspired the subject matter/name we featured on the labels. We admit - we did not learn how to brew and bottle beer prior to creating this design (although that would have been quite an adventure); we used a case of Yuengling and applied the cut vinyl to the box and bottles.

Below are a few images of the environmental theming design Stoner Graphix created for Freddyâ€™s trophy room. All the textures on the walls, ceiling, doors, and bar were digitally printed on either corrugated plastic or vinyl and attached to the surfaces. I assisted various tasks throughout the process - mostly using the large format printers to print some of the corrugated plastic and vinyl.
