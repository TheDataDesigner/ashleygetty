Below are a few examples of freestanding exterior signs I designed while working at Stoner Graphix. Each client had specific requests such as color scheme, shape, style, etc. I was able to work with their individual needs to create specific designs that would go on to be printed, assembled, and installed.

        <p>This sign design was a collaboration. I was responsible for the sign layout and sizing, as well as adding color to the existing illustration and adding the finishing touches to the design.</p>
        <p>All other designs were created by me and are property of Stoner Graphix.</p>
