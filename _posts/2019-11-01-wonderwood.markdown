The Wonderwood is a rustic lakeside lodge located in Grand Lake, Colorado. I had the pleasure of creating a logo & website for this beautiful alpine getaway. Once the logo design was chosen, I began designing the site. I created a design that allowed the photography of the lodge to speak for itself and create a perfect foundation for the rest of the site. Some of the website's features include local attractions, an amenities list, photo gallery, and contact info page. I wrote all the site's copy, and used my hand lettering skills to create a header for each interior page. I then built a responsive website using the Divi plugin on WordPress, which allows a high degree of design customization.
