In 2019 I had the pleasure of doing some contract work for Uplight, an energy software company in Boulder, CO. I assisted the internal design team in whatever way I was needed, creating items that ranged from complex software product mockups to simple ads for print. All designs featured different applications of Uplight's vibrant, already-existing brand style which was so fun to work with! I've included a brief description of each project below.

        <p>The logo concepts below were created for an internal branding project. Ultimately these concepts did not end up being used but I enjoyed working with the prismatic shapes and colors nonetheless!</p>

        <p>I was tasked with updating the product mockups for Uplight's entire software suite. Since Uplight is a relatively new company (formed in 2019 as a merger of 6 different companies in the energy industry), the previous mockup images featured multiple different styles since they were originally taken from each legacy company. I created a new, streamlined style that could be applied to each product mockup. These designs will be used for applications such as marketing collateral and client-facing presentations.</p>
