        <p>I’m a designer and illustrator based in Denver, Colorado. I'm originally from Pennsylvania, and called it home until September of 2017. I’ll always have a special place in my heart for the East Coast, but the call of the West was just too strong to keep me there. Prior to my move, I worked for over three years as a designer at Stoner Graphix, a sign company near Hershey, PA. I am currently working full time as a designer at Worboys Design, a small but mighty creative agency in Denver.</p>
        <p>Now that I’ve covered all the important things, here are a few extra morsels of information you may (or may not) be interested in learning about me.</p>
        <p>I have an unhealthy obsession with bacon. If you surprise me with bacon, you earn my instant respect and gratitude. I will take every opportunity possible to make a pun, and about 85% of the time, I’m the only one who laughs at it (I’m completely fine with that). On any given weekend, you can probably find me in the mountains hiking, backpacking, or scaling peaks. Lastly, I knit about as much as your grandmother’s grandmother. Really - I’m knitting as I type this.</p>
        <p>Now that you know a bit about me, I would love to get to know you! Check out my social media accounts or shoot me an email if you’d like to talk! I’m always accepting new work, and of course, free bacon.</p>
